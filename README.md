# Presentation
BackupScript is a bash script that allows you to backup a Linux server or machine directly in Infomaniak's kDrive and/or SwissBackup. It can also use other Rclone configurations for backup destinations.
It natively includes support for Zabbix and Grafana as well as Discord notifications.

# Utilisation
Clone the script on your machine: 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/PAPAMICA/Backup-Script
```
Go to the folder:
```sh
cd Backup-Script
```
Edit the file `backup-script.conf` with your settings :
```sh
nano backup-script.conf
```
Run the script :
```sh
./backup-script.sh
```

## Cronjog
Start backup every day at 02h
```sh
crontab -e
00 02 * * * /apps/Backup-Script/backup-script.sh >> /var/log/BackupScript.log
```

## The available settings
### Dry run
With  `--dry-run` you can preview what the script will do before you run it.
### List backup
With `--list-backup <CONFIG_RCLONE>` you can list the backups available in your outsourced storage.
### Zabbix send
With `--zabbix-send` you can force the sending of the latest data collected to Zabbix.

## Zabbix
To use backup monitoring with Zabbix, you must import and assign the template to your host `Template_Zabbix_App_BackupScript.xml`.
The first sending of data can be long or failed, do not hesitate to renew with :
```sh
./backup-script.sh --zabbix-send
```
## Grafana
You can import the template `Template_Grafana_BackupScript.json` directly in your Grafana instance.
You will need to modify the variable `$SERVER` in order to use the template correctly.
